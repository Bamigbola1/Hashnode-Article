# Introduction 
Passenger Satisfaction in the airline industry is a complex customer knowledge and experience and can be defined as an assessment that passengers have encountered. (Tahanisaz, & Shokuhyar, S., 2020).

This Project is a practice project 
provided by www.mavenanalytics.io

**Project question:**
Assuming the role of Senior Data Analyst for&nbsp; Maven Airlines, a US-based airline headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The latest passenger survey results just came in and it looks like the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time ever. The leadership team needs to take action fast, so there’s a need to analyze the data and find the key areas to focus on for getting back on track. 
The task is to&nbsp; recommend a data-driven strategy for increasing Maven Airlines' satisfaction rate, and present it in the form of a report and dashboard.

# Data Wrangling 
The dataset was downloaded from http://app.mavenanalytics.io/datasets. it was duplicated, and cleaned; ensuring that only relevant columns were left for performing the analysis, and null values were checked, using Excel and Power BI.

### Analysis 5 (Average Departure Delay)
Analysis 5 shows that there is an average departure delay of 15.08m across all customer class, returning and first-time passengers. 
I recommend that factors that affect departure delay should be looked into, both external and internal factors. Passengers are more satisfied with less or no departure delay.

### Analysis 6 (Average Arrival Delay)
This analysis shows that there is an average of 14.71m arrival delay across all customer class, returning and first-time passengers.
I recommend that Airlines should work on factors that will reduce or eliminate arrival delays and Passengers should have good information about the Flight preceding.

# Conclusion
No doubt, Customer Satisfaction plays a key role in the revenue growth of an airline, and from my analysis, it is clear that Customer Experience determines how much of a competitive advantage an airline will have over another. The airline recorded more Dissatisfaction than Satisfaction, which led to low patronage. This was due to service shortfall in the bottom five(5) services listed in analysis 7. 

**What I recommend**


Here are the three areas that I believe will drive a positive impact on the customer, and which I recommend the airline to explore when they commit to improving passenger experience:

1.	Services should be improved for the Economy and Economy Plus Classes, both classes recorded a high percentage of dissatisfaction, and it's noteworthy that they make up a large number of the total patronage. If they are more satisfied, they will return more revenue to the airline. the airline should have different delivery strategies based on the customer seat class.
2.	The airline should focus more on their strength which is the top 5 satisfied services, customers are happy to have those services in their travel experience. Also, the airline should strongly improve on the top 5 most dissatisfied services, if the services can be improved, it can cause a drastic change in revenue and result in more patronage. Customers won't bother with long-distance travel with a good In-Flight Service. 
3. The Airline can include Loyalty reward programs, these programs will keep the customers engaged with the airline and also build a good customer relationship and commitment, thereby increasing satisfaction.

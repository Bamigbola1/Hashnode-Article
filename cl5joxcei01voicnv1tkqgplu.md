## Global Suicide Rate Analysis

Suicide is not the bravest thing one can ever do, on the other hand, the bravest thing to do is to continue life when it seems there is no more hope.
Life is like a game of chess. To win you have to make a move. Knowing which move to make comes with insight and knowledge, and learning the lessons accumulated along the way.

The aim of this project is to evaluate the rate of suicide globally and call for suicide awareness as about 800,000 people die from suicide every year globally.

## Life Expectancy Insight Analysis

# **Abstract**

Life expectancy has increased rapidly since the Age of Enlightenment. In the early 19th century, life expectancy started to increase in the early industrialized countries while it stayed low in the rest of the world. This led to very high inequality in how health was distributed across the world. Good health in the rich countries and persistently bad health in those countries that remained poor. Over the last decades, this global inequality decreased. No country in the world has a lower life expectancy than the countries with the highest life expectancy in 1800. Many countries that not long ago were suffering from bad health are catching up rapidly.

## **Introduction**

This project is on Life Expectancy Insight Analysis, provided by Side Hustle Nigeria. The analysis is to answer the following questions.


- Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect Life expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting life expectancy?

- Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?

- How do Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?

- Does Life Expectancy has a positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol, etc.

- What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?

- Does Life Expectancy have a positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?

- Do densely populated countries tend to have a lower life expectancy?

- What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?
 
## **Data Wrangling**

The dataset was scraped from Github. The data was prepared and analyzed with Microsoft Excel and Power Bi tools.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**

### Analysis 1 ( Average Immunization by Continent)

This analysis shows that the highest immunizations were for Polio and Measles in Asia and Africa respectively, while Oceana had the lowest immunization of all continents.

## Analysis 2 ( Average Population by life Expectancy)

This analysis shows that countries having a life expectancy of 65 years had the highest population while countries having life expectancy below 60 years and above 70 years had the lowest population.

## Analysis 3 ( Average Polio, Measles, Hepatitis B Immunizations by life Expectancy)


The analysis shows that most immunizations were taken by those having a life expectancy of 50 - 60 years.

## Analysis 4 ( Average Adult mortality, HIV/AIDS, and life expectancy by Continent)

This analysis shows that Africa has the highest adult mortality rate and lowest life expectancy while Australia has the highest life expectancy and lowest adult mortality rate, as a result, it can be said that the adult mortality rate is inversely proportional to life expectancy.

## Analysis 5 ( Average Nutrition by life Expectancy)

This analysis shows that with a decrease in the Prevalence of thinness among children for Age 5 to 9(%) and the Prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents for Age 10 to 19, life expectancy increases while life expectancy increases as the number of years spent in school increases.

## Analysis 6 ( Alcohol Consumption by life Expectancy)

The analysis was rather amusing as it shows that Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in liters of pure alcohol) reduces as life expectancy approaches 60 but increases exponentially thereafter.

# **Conclusion**
An increase in years spent in schools leads to enlightenment and better health decisions. Also, countries having better nutrition tend to have a higher life expectancy. The mean % of immunization coverage in developed countries is higher by 15.8%.  When a country enrolls more of the population in school and ensures more are fed it leads to improved nutrition and in turn improved life expectancy.
